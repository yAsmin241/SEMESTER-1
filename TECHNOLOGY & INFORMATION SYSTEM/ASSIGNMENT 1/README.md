## ðŸ’¡Reflection
<p align= "justify">
Having an industry visit to Petronas and Huawei gives a lot of knowledge. They gave bunch of motivation and inspiration to the students on how to become a professional in this computer science field. They told us that this is not an easy journey to go through and we have to keep on going and never ever stop learning. They also share their experiences on how working in the big company life is, to some people it may looks stressful, but to them, they really loves their job because theyâ€™re surrounded by  very positive and supportive colleagues. Therefore, as what the speakers all said, we must love what we are doing because when we are happy we could produce a good solution, idea and product.
