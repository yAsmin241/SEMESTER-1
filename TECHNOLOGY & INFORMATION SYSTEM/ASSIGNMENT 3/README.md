Having an industry talk about credence gives an exposure to me on how credence company works. As what miss Qistina mentioned in her talk that credence is specializing in Cloud Advisory, Migration, SaaS, analytics, and application modernization. Therefore, thatâ€™s why Credence boasts a unique end-to-end portfolio from infrastructure to insights. In her talk she also mentioned about the technology and tools that are used in Credence. In addition, miss Qistina also do share about the skills that are required to be a data engineer which help us a lot to achieve it at an early stage.
