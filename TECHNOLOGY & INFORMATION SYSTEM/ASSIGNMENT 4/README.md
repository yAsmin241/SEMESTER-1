## ðŸ’¡Reflection
<p align= "justify">
Having an opportunity to have an industry visit to UTM Digital gives a lot of exposure to us, as a student in UTM itself. Along the tour journey, we got to know a glimpse of how does the people behind the e-learning and UTM Smart system works to give the best service to the students. We also get the opportunity to visit the database room where all the UTM data stored. In the database room, the database administrator shares an experience on how the inside of the database room looks like, which gives us a motivation to be like him one day and get to feel the same experience as him. A lot of intakes that I can get from the tour as their office provide a free siting, which means the workers can work anywhere they want because I trust that when we have a comfortable place and always changing our view, it could help us generates more idea rather than just sitting at the same place for every single day.
