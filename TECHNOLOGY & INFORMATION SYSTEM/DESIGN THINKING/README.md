## ðŸ’¡Reflection 
<p align= "justify">
Design thinking, in my perspective, is incredibly important to reaching my objective. This is because I have a big ambition or objective, thus I could solve the huge task by using my understanding of design thinking conceptsÂ into more manageable pieces. Once the problem has been divided into different phases, I can concentrate on what steps I need to take and continue from there. 
As a result, nothing will be overlooked, and the result will be exactly what I had in mind.
