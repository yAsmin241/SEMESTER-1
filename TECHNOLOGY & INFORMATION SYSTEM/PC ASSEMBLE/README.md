There are a lot of benefits that I could gain by having a PC Assembly activity. This is because,Â Â I couldÂ increased myÂ understanding of how computerÂ hardware functions and how it significantly affects how well a computer canÂ operates. Furthermore, PC assemblyÂ activities exposed me on how toÂ buildÂ our own personal computer by selecting the best components depending on our preferences and needs. For example, choosing the best processor, graphics card, RAM, and other components.
