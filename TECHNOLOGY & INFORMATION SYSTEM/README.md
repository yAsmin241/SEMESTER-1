## üí°Reflection

<h3>üåêIndustry Visit and Talk</h3>
<p align= "justify">
The industrial talks and visits were eye-opening experiences that significantly broadened and strengthened my understanding of the professional landscape of the field. The visits allowed me to observe the advanced technology and the job scope of those professional employees, making abstract concepts more real. The phrase "learning never stops" left the biggest impression on me. There'll always be that thing we don't know, but that doesn't mean we should give up trying to know it all. Thus, lifelong learning means everything we don't know is something we can learn, and this is the most precious lesson I have learned. The assignments also required teamwork, which is something else I learned a lot about. I gain communication and idea-expression skills from my team members, but occasionally I struggle to come up with ideas and lack the confidence to voice my opinions. I must therefore work on improving myself in the upcoming semester.
  
<h3>üåüImprovement</h3>
I believe I should be more confident in expressing my opinions. Building confidence in articulating my thoughts will not only enhance my communication skills but also empower me to actively contribute to discussions and collaborations. Seeking opportunities to share my ideas and perspectives will not only help me grow individually but also foster a more dynamic and engaging learning environment. This improvement is crucial for my personal development and will undoubtedly contribute to my academic and professional journey.
